# RealEstateManagementSystem

Author: Yu Tian

This project is for my CSC330 Object-Oriented Software Design. The whole project is built on a local database, which has 
4 tables to store information including Agents, Customers, Offers, and Properties. 

It has 2 UI interfaces, one is for agent, who has authority to create new property, delete property, modify information 
of the property, see the offer lists for the properties and make decisions to the offers, the other one is for customer, 
who can create a new account, view the information about property, make an offer to a property and check whether the 
offer is accepted or declined.

Environment: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2013
